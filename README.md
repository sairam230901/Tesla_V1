# Tesla_V1
Tesla_V1 is an arduino based; IR sensor line follower with obstacle avoidance using Ultrasonic sensor

First before coding, check the direction of rotation of motors using the code given in folder 1, so that if motori.run(FORWARD),motori.run(RELEASE),motori.run(BACKWARD) : for every i in range 2, 4 ( where i represents no of motors used) work properly.
